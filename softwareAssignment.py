        Initialize the search engine, i.e. create or read in index. If
        create=True, the search index should be created and written to
        files. If create=False, the search index should be read from
        the files. The collectionName points to the filename of the
        document collection (without the .xml at the end). Hence, you
        can read the documents from <collectionName>.xml, and should
        write / read the idf index to / from <collectionName>.idf, and
        the tf index to / from <collectionName>.tf respectively. All
        of these files must reside in the same folder as THIS file. If
        your program does not adhere to this "interface
        specification", we will subtract some points as it will be
        impossible for us to test your program automatically!
